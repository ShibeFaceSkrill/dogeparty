  The following is my personal analysis of the NFT minted on the Dogecoin blockchain. It should not be construed as investment advice. Take any investment decisions at your own risk.

  Full disclosure, I have spent around $200 usd, worth of Dogeparty assets, among the collections featured in this article. Check the [ShibeFaceSkrill Dogeparty Treasury](https://dogeparty.xchain.io/address/DH1293j9GQeDwuKBJkDpdWRX5YGEWw2JBY).

<b>What? NFT on DOGECOIN? How can it be true!?!?!</b>

<a href="https://twitter.com/w3b_eth/status/1530106334712037379/photo/1"><img class="img-responsive img-rounded img-fluid" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/top-dogecoin-nft/historical/W3B-NFT_24-Hour-Clock_history-of-nft.webp" style="width:100%;"></a><br>

<p>As you can see if you zoom in on the above W3B/NFT History 24 Hour World Clock, Namecoin domains were the first Non-Fungible assets, created in 2011. In January 2014, the Counterparty protocol <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151005150723/http://www.minyanville.com/business-news/editors-pick/articles/The-People-Who-Burn-Bitcoins-bitcoin/4/16/2014/id/54627?refresh=1">was deployed on Bitcoin</a>.</p>

Its users burning Bitcoin in exchange for its native currency XCP, as an alternative to ICO schemes where founders must be trusted to manage user funds in developing the platform.

Dogeparty was introduced as a more cost friendly alternative, shortly afterwards, to avoid costly Bitcoin transaction fees.

The first NFT with images on the dogecoin blockchain were [minted in August 2014](https://doggfather.medium.com/dogeparty-nft-meta-layer-on-top-of-dogecoin-part-1-3105d7b24abf) and the platform fell into disuse after a few years, not developing as wide of use vs its Bitcoin counterpart.

[Dogeparty relaunched in August 2021](https://doggfather.medium.com/dogeparty-what-has-happened-since-relaunch-in-fall-2021-part-2-47a324303080) and has a vibrant, supportive, community. 

<h2 id="top-nft-collections-on-dogecoin">Top NFT Collections on Dogecoin</h2>

There are three main categories of NFT available on the Dogecoin blockchain through the use of Dogeparty infrastructure.

1. Historical (2014-2016)
2. Card Style (a'la 'Magic the Gathering')
3. Profile Pic (such as have taken the world by storm)

The historical NFT on Dogecoin aren't so much a single collection, but for the purposes of this article we'll consider them so. 

My opinion is that the historical NFT are the most universally valuable assets on the doge blockchain. These have a new and growing market of blockchain historians who see value in owning a piece of blockchain history.

Within the Dogeparty community Rare Doge is made by the largest subset of that community, and involves living tradition that spans multiple chains. I believe they have the highest cultural value within the Doge community.

On the other-hand, the PFP collections have the closest resemblance to what the world has come to think of as NFT, and are likely to have the strongest appeal for NFT collectors coming from the greater crypto ecosystem.

Of the historical assets minted on dogeparty, 65 of them have open <a href="https://dogermint.com/dispensers/#what-is-a-dispenser">dispensers</a> and are available for purchase. Among those available on Dogecoin thru Dogeparty dispensers, 29 have images. 

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
  Dogeparty Dispensers are a special Dogecoin address that distribute tokens automatically to users who send the exact amount of required funds to that address.

The single biggest supplier of historical assets on Dogeparty is <a href="https://www.dogermint.com/">Dogermint</a>, which has makes available a starter pack of 133 Dogermint tokens, for 1000 DOGE.

during the creation of this article I connected with creator of <a href="https://www.vaje.art/">Vaje.art</a> who recently made a multi-asset dispenser for historical assets.

Note: the following assets are all on the same dispenser address. If you go to <a href="https://dogeparty.xchain.io/address/D99C1KTb4x8qHwyiGbksjtzzov3tRE3jwQ">NYZBlossom's Address</a> and click dispensers you can verify they are all on the same address and dispense for the same amount. <b>Send funds only once, they are on the same dispenser.</b>

<h3 id="card-style">Trading\Game Card Style </h3>
<h4 id="rare-doge">Rare Doge</h4>

RareDoge are made with trading card styled artworks, or at least in the shape of those cards. There are nearly 800 individual RareDoge cards in existence, spread across 17 series. 

I would consider RareDoge, and other card-style collections such as Trippy Tokens and Dank Doge Club to be the heart of Dogeparty. This is where the greatest amount of community activity and attention is focused around.
