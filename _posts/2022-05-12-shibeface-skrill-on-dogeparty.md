  ShibeFaceSkrill is releasing a series of NFT collections featuring the faces of Shiba Inu, exploring financial use-cases across multiple blockchains.

## Initially, we planned to begin this journey on Ethereum

**Ethereum is a blockchain full of legacy**

While Bitcoin brought decentralized digital currency to the world, it was Ethereum's smart-contracts that popularized it and helped inspire the speculative fervor of 2017 and the explosion of an ecosystem of ecosystems and industry to touch all other industries.

- Ethereum is where Cryptokitties shut down the blockchain during the peak of that bull-run!
- Ethereum is where 10k NFT collections exploded became a widespread cultural and economic phenomenon in 2021
- Ethereum is where collectors have predominantly looked for valuable NFT to collect

I had many reasons why to *begin* a cross-chain exploration of NFT utility on the Ethereum blockchain.

## That was before I discovered Dogeparty!!!

When I first learned about NFT, a few years ago, they were called "Digitally Rare Art". Some of the earliest example were minted on the Bitcoin blockchain.

<center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sfdogeparty/rarepepe.webp" style="width:100%;"><br>
<sup><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/matt-furie-adds-to-2016-nft-card-collection-rare-pepe-directory-is-complete-says-nft-wallet-creator/">Matt Furie Adds to 2016 NFT Card Collection — 'Rare Pepe Directory Is Complete,' Says NFT Wallet Creator</a></sup></center>

Rare Pepe was probably the first collection to achieve financial success, with individual card trading for [hundreds of thousands of dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Pepe#History), at auctions and in the aftermarket. 

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  These '<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rare-pepe">Rare Pepe</a>' were minted on the Bitcoin blockchain, using <a href="https://counterparty.io/">Counterparty</a>, which gets its functionality by "<a href="https://counterparty.io/docs/protocol_specification/">writing in the margins</a>" of a regular bitcoin transaction. 
</div>

Due to costly Bitcoin fees, Counterparty was deployed to the Dogecoin blockchain in August 2014, dubbed Dogeparty, giving birth to an assortment of historic NFT. About 2 years later during the depth of the crypto bear market, Dogeparty nodes began shutting down.

In 2021, some Counterparty developers brought Dogeparty back to life, allowing the Dogecoin community to access this powerful technology for minting NFT directly on the Dogecoin blockchain

<b>Knowing its legacy, and place in Bitcoin history, when I realized that Counterparty was forked for use on Dogecoin, I was instantly sold</b>.

## Mint NFT and other tokens on the Dogecoin blockchain!

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sfdogeparty/welcome-to-the-dogeparty.png" style="width:100%;">

Dogecoiners love quirky memes with our favorite dog and its supportive community. 

Dogeparty takes everything thats great about Dogecoin and just adds tools enabling permissionless finance. 

With Dogeparty on the Dogecoin blockchain, its easy and affordable for anyone to mint NFT and other assets, regardless of technical experience, including a [rich feature-set](https://dogeparty.net/#features) covering common needs.

**The Dogeparty community is fun, inclusive and friendly! Just like the Doge(coin) community it forms a part of.**

Unlike Ethereum smart-contracts, [Dogeparty wallets](https://dogeparty.net/wallets) include automated functions for common features, leaving you to focus on the fun parts of releasing crypto tokens: arts, utility, supply, distribution and community development.

## A _Doge_-Cultural Experience

If you love the cultures surrounding Dogecoin, cryptocurrency, and internet histories, it doesn't get much better than Dogeparty. Dogeparty scratches that particular set of itches in a way no other platform can achieve.

<p>Lately I've been doing some deep studies into Doge NFT. I've looked on Ethereum, Matic, Solana, and Dogecoin, to determine which are the most important Doge NFT collections worth paying attention to.</p>

<p>There are some great DOGE NFT communities out there, and in future we'll cover Ethereum and other chains, but as far as Doge NFT, nothing compares to the artwork available right here on the Dogecoin blockchain.</p>

<p>There is a wide variety in the highest of quality arts and memes available via Dogeparty, right on the Dogecoin blockchain.</p> 

<p>They are not all necessarily fitting to the common mold of what ETH 10k PFP collections have imprinted on the market. All the same, some are quite competitive, both artistically and memetically, to what we've come to expect from leading NFT projects.</p>

## Dogeparty was there since the early days of crypto-assets

A noteworthy feature of Dogeparty is its historical significance in NFT culture and the Bitcoin space.

Dogeparty was initially active from [August 2014 to May 2016](https://doggfather.medium.com/dogeparty-nft-meta-layer-on-top-of-dogecoin-part-1-3105d7b24abf) (H/T [Doggfather](https://twitter.com/DoggfatherC)), and was relaunched in [August 2021](https://doggfather.medium.com/dogeparty-what-has-happened-since-relaunch-in-fall-2021-part-2-47a324303080).

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/sfdogeparty/historical-NFT-chart_2011-2014.png" style="width:100%;">

The first NFT on Dogecoin (JOLLY ROGER + MILKYWAY) were minted in August 2014, a full year before the [first nft on Ethereum](https://etheria.world/whatis.html).

The digital antiquities market has only begun to form, but is growing rapidly. 

Now is the perfect time to source own a piece of history, from the earliest days of cryptocurrency, on the Dogecoin blockchain. 

## Dogeparty has a growing ecosystem of related tools and integrations

Dogecoin has proven its staying power, and continued relevance in the blockchain space. Similar to its Doge-chain, Dogeparty is more relevant today, than ever. Thanks to the good people at the Dogeparty Foundation, and our growing community, you can expect to see this list grow!
