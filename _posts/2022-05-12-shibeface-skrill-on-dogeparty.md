  ShibeFaceSkrill is releasing a series of NFT collections featuring the faces of Shiba Inu, exploring financial use-cases, across multiple blockchains.

## Initially, the plan was to begin our journey on Ethereum... 

**Ethereum is a blockchain full of legacy**

Ethereum's smart-contract blockchain spurred much development and helped to inspire the speculative fervor of 2017...

...where Cryptokitties shut down the blockchain during the peak of that bull-run!
...Ethereum is where 10k NFT collections exploded became a widspread cultural and economic phenomenon in 2021
...Ethereum is where collectors have predomenantly looked for valuable NFT to collect.

I had many reasons why to *begin* a cross-chain exploration of NFT utility on the Ethereum blockchain.

## That was before I disovered Dogeparty!!!

You see, when I first learned about NFT, a few years ago, they were commonly referred to as "Digitally Rare Art". Among these historically ancient NFT, Rare Pepe was among the earliest financially sucessful NFT collections, with individual cards having sold for [hundreds of thousands of dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Pepe#History), at auctions and in the after market. 

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  These '<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rare-pepe">Rare Pepe</a>' were minted on the Bitcoin blockchain, using Counterparty XDP, which gets its functionality by "<a href="https://counterparty.io/docs/protocol_specification/">writing in the margins</a>" of a regular bitcoin transaction.

<br>Knowing all of this, <b>once I discovered that Dogeparty is the same as Counterparty, except on Dogecoin, "<em>the people's blockchain</em>", I was instantly sold</b>.

## What's so great about Dogeparty?
### #1 Its FUN!

Everything that's great about Doge the meme and $DOGE the coin: plus it's easy and affordable for anyone to mint assets, without coding experience, including a rich feature-set covering common needs. 

**The Dogeparty community is fun, inclusive and friendly! Just like the Doge(coin) community it forms a part of.**

It's fun to mint assets and think about their supply\distribution\use-cases. 

### It's Cultural

If you love the culture of Doge, cryptocurrency, and thier histories, then it doesn't get any better than Dogeparty.

<p>Lately I've been doing some pretty deep studies into doge nft on Ethereum, Solana, and Dogecoin, trying to determine which are the important Doge NFT projects.</p>

<p>There are some great NFT out there, but as far as Doge NFT, nothing compares to the artwork right here on the Dogecoin blockchain.</p>

<p>Available on the Dogecoin blockchain, via Dogeparty, there is a wide variety in the highest of quality arts and memes.</p> 

<p>They are not all necessarily fitting to the common mold of what ETH 10k PFP collections have imprinted on the market, however, some are quite competitive artistically and memetically to what we've come to expect from leading NFT projects.</p>

### Its Historic

One of the most important and noteworthy features of Dogeparty is its historical significance in NFT culture and the Bitcoin space.

Dogeparty was initially active from August 2014 to May 2016 (H/T [Doggfather](https://doggfather.medium.com/dogeparty-nft-meta-layer-on-top-of-dogecoin-part-1-3105d7b24abf)), and was relaunched in [August 2021](https://doggfather.medium.com/dogeparty-what-has-happened-since-relaunch-in-fall-2021-part-2-47a324303080).

You can own a piece of history, from the earliest days of cryptocurrency, on the Dogecoin blockchain. 

The digital antiquities market has only begun to form, but is growing rapidly. Especially connected to Dogecoin, which has proven its staying power, and continued relevance. 

Dogecoin is more popular than ever, and the next most popular meme-coin, is named after the breed of dog, Shiba Inu, featured in the iconic [Doge meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge).
