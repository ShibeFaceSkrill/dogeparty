ShibeFaceSkrill is releasing a series of NFT collections, featuring the faces of Shiba Inu, and exploring financial use-cases for NFT across multiple blockchains.

Initially, the plan was to begin our journey on Ethereum, which is the home chain where NFT became a real widspread cultural phenomenon, and where NFT collectors have predomenantly looked for valuable NFT to collect.

## That was before I disovered Dogeparty!!!

You see, when I first learned about NFT, they were referred to as "Digitally Rare Art". Among these historically ancient NFT, Rare Pepe was arguably the most popular, at least the most financially relelvant having sold for [hundreds of thousands of dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Pepe#History), at auctions and in the after market. 

These '[Rare Pepe](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rare-pepe)' were minted on the Bitcoin blockchain, using Counterparty XDP, which gets its functionality by "[writing in the margins](https://counterparty.io/docs/protocol_specification/)" of a regular bitcoin transaction.

Knowing all of this, as soon as I discovered there was a version of Counterparty on Dogecoin, "the people's blockchain", I was instantly sold.

## What's so great about Dogeparty?
### Its FUN!

Everything that's great about Doge the meme and $DOGE the coin, plus it's easy and affordable for anyone to mint assets, with a rich feature-set covering common needs. 

**The Dogeparty community is fun, inclusive and friendly! Just like the Doge(coin) community it forms a part of.**

If you love Dogecoin and making\collecting art (with pictures of your favorite Doge, or not), then why wouldn't you?!

### Its Historical

Dogeparty was initially active from August 2014 to May 2016 (H/T [Doggfather](https://doggfather.medium.com/dogeparty-nft-meta-layer-on-top-of-dogecoin-part-1-3105d7b24abf)), and was relaunched in [August 2021](https://doggfather.medium.com/dogeparty-what-has-happened-since-relaunch-in-fall-2021-part-2-47a324303080).

You can own a piece of history, from the earliest days of cryptocurrency, on the Dogecoin blockchain. 

The digital antiquities market has only begun to form, but is growing rapidly. Especially connected to Dogecoin, which has proven its staying power, and continued relevance. Especially when you consider that Dogecoin is way more popular than it ever was, and the next most popular meme-coin, on Ethereum, is named after the breed of dog, Shiba Inu, featured in the iconic Doge meme.
