  ShibeFaceSkrill is releasing a series of NFT collections featuring the faces of Shiba Inu, exploring financial use-cases across multiple blockchains.

## Initially, the plan was to begin our journey on Ethereum... 

**Ethereum is a blockchain full of legacy**

Ethereum's smart-contract blockchain spurred much development and helped to inspire the speculative fervor of 2017...

...where Cryptokitties shut down the blockchain during the peak of that bull-run!
...Ethereum is where 10k NFT collections exploded became a widspread cultural and economic phenomenon in 2021
...Ethereum is where collectors have predomenantly looked for valuable NFT to collect.

I had many reasons why to *begin* a cross-chain exploration of NFT utility on the Ethereum blockchain.

## That was before I disovered Dogeparty!!!

You see, when I first learned about NFT, a few years ago, they were commonly referred to as "Digitally Rare Art". Among these historically ancient NFT, Rare Pepe was among the earliest financially sucessful NFT collections, with individual cards having sold for [hundreds of thousands of dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Pepe#History), at auctions and in the after market. 

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  These '<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rare-pepe">Rare Pepe</a>' were minted on the Bitcoin blockchain, using Counterparty XDP, which gets its functionality by "<a href="https://counterparty.io/docs/protocol_specification/">writing in the margins</a>" of a regular bitcoin transaction.

<br><b>Once I learned Dogeparty is Counterparty, but on Dogecoin, "<em>the people's blockchain</em>", I was instantly sold</b>.

## Mint NFT and other tokens on the Dogecoin blockchain!

Dogecoiners love quirky memes and our supportive community. Dogeparty takes everything thats great about Dogecoin, and adds tools enabling permissionless finance. 

With Dogeparty and the Dogecoin blockchain easy and affordable for anyone to mint NFT and other assets, without coding experience, including a [rich featureset](https://dogeparty.net/#features) covering common needs. 

**The Dogeparty community is fun, inclusive and friendly! Just like the Doge(coin) community it forms a part of.**

Unlike Ethereum smart-contracts, Dogeparty wallet includes automated functions for common features, leaving you to focus on arts, supply, distribution, utility and community development.

## A _Doge_-Cultural Experience

If you love the cultures surrounding Dogecoin, cryptocurrency, and internet histories, it doesn't get much better than Dogeparty. Dogeparty scratches a particular set of itches, all using the people's blockchain, Dogecoin.

<p>Lately I've been doing some pretty deep studies into Doge NFT. I've looked on Ethereum, Matic, Solana, and Dogecoin, determining which are the most important Doge NFT projects worth paying attention to.</p>

<p>There are some great DOGE NFT communities out there, and in future this blog will discuss other chains, but as far as Doge NFT, nothing compares to the artwork right here on the Dogecoin blockchain.</p>

<p>Available on the Dogecoin blockchain, via Dogeparty, there is a wide variety in the highest of quality arts and memes.</p> 

<p>They are not all necessarily fitting to the common mold of what ETH 10k PFP collections have imprinted on the market. All the same, some are quite competitive, both artistically and memetically, to what we've come to expect from leading NFT projects.</p>

## Dogeparty is an essential part of crypto-history

One of the most important and noteworthy features of Dogeparty is its historical significance in NFT culture and the Bitcoin space.

Dogeparty was initially active from [August 2014 to May 2016](https://doggfather.medium.com/dogeparty-nft-meta-layer-on-top-of-dogecoin-part-1-3105d7b24abf) (H/T [Doggfather](https://twitter.com/DoggfatherC)), and was relaunched in [August 2021](https://doggfather.medium.com/dogeparty-what-has-happened-since-relaunch-in-fall-2021-part-2-47a324303080).

![](/assets/images/sfdogeparty/historical-NFT-chart_2011-2014.png)

The first NFT on Dogecoin (JOLLY ROGER + MILKYWAY) were minted in August 2014, a full year before the [first nft on Ethereum](https://etheria.world/whatis.html).

You can own a piece of history, from the earliest days of cryptocurrency, on the Dogecoin blockchain.
