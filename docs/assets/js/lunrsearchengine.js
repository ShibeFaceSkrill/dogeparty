    "body": "2022/05/13 - The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter. An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.  It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes. As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.

    "body": "2022/05/12 -  ShibeFaceSkrill is releasing a series of NFT collections featuring the faces of Shiba Inu, exploring financial use-cases across multiple blockchains. Initially, the plan was to begin our journey on Ethereum…: Ethereum is a blockchain full of legacy Ethereum’s smart-contract blockchain spurred much development and helped to inspire the speculative fervor of 2017… …where Cryptokitties shut down the blockchain during the peak of that bull-run!…Ethereum is where 10k NFT collections exploded became a widspread cultural and economic phenomenon in 2021…Ethereum is where collectors have predomenantly looked for valuable NFT to collect. I had many reasons why to begin a cross-chain exploration of NFT utility on the Ethereum blockchain. That was before I disovered Dogeparty!!!: You see, when I first learned about NFT, a few years ago, they were commonly referred to as “Digitally Rare Art”. Among these historically ancient NFT, Rare Pepe was among the earliest financially sucessful NFT collections, with individual cards having sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars, at auctions and in the after market.  These 'Rare Pepe' were minted on the Bitcoin blockchain, using Counterparty XDP, which gets its functionality by  writing in the margins  of a regular bitcoin transaction. Matt Furie Adds to 2016 NFT Card Collection — 'Rare Pepe Directory Is Complete,' Says NFT Wallet CreatorOnce I learned Dogeparty is Counterparty, but on Dogecoin, “the people’s blockchain”, I was instantly sold. Mint NFT and other tokens on the Dogecoin blockchain!: Dogecoiners love quirky memes and our supportive community. Dogeparty takes everything thats great about Dogecoin, and adds tools enabling permissionless finance. With Dogeparty and the Dogecoin blockchain easy and affordable for anyone to mint NFT and other assets, without coding experience, including a rich featureset covering common needs. The Dogeparty community is fun, inclusive and friendly! Just like the Doge(coin) community it forms a part of. Unlike Ethereum smart-contracts, Dogeparty wallet includes automated functions for common features, leaving you to focus on arts, supply, distribution, utility and community development. A Doge-Cultural Experience: If you love the cultures surrounding Dogecoin, cryptocurrency, and internet histories, it doesn’t get much better than Dogeparty. Dogeparty scratches a particular set of itches, all using the people’s blockchain, Dogecoin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Rare Doge DirectoryLately I've been doing some pretty deep studies into Doge NFT. I've looked on Ethereum, Matic, Solana, and Dogecoin, determining which are the most important Doge NFT projects worth paying attention to. There are some great DOGE NFT communities out there, and in future we'll discuss other chains, but as far as Doge NFT, nothing compares to the artwork right here on the Dogecoin blockchain.                         Real Doge Punks — Doge PixelsAvailable on the Dogecoin blockchain, via Dogeparty, there is a wide variety in the highest of quality arts and memes. They are not all necessarily fitting to the common mold of what ETH 10k PFP collections have imprinted on the market, however, some are quite competitive, artistically and memetically, to what we've come to expect from leading NFT projects. Dogeparty is an essential part of crypto-history: One of the most important and noteworthy features of Dogeparty is its historical significance in NFT culture and the Bitcoin space. Dogeparty was initially active from August 2014 to May 2016 (H/T Doggfather), and was relaunched in August 2021.  The first NFT on Dogecoin (JOLLY ROGER + MILKYWAY) were minted in August 2014, a full year before the first nft on Ethereum. You can own a piece of history, from the earliest days of cryptocurrency, on the Dogecoin blockchain.

If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown! As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: 123. my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}HTML: 12345&lt;li class= ml-1 mr-1 &gt;  &lt;a target= _blank  href= # &gt;  &lt;i class= fab fa-twitter &gt;&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;CSS: 12345678. highlight . c {  color: #999988;  font-style: italic; }. highlight . err {  color: #a61717;  background-color: #e3d2d2; }JS: 123456789// alertbar later$(document). scroll(function () {  var y = $(this). scrollTop();  if (y &gt; 280) {    $('. alertbar'). fadeIn();  } else {    $('. alertbar'). fadeOut();  }});Python: 1print( Hello World )Ruby: 123require 'redcarpet'markdown = Redcarpet. new( Hello World! )puts markdown. to_htmlC: 1printf( Hello World ); Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. Full HTML: Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits!
